# First-project
This is my first project on github..
Introducing Omni Food: A dynamic web  project showcasing my journey into web development using HTML, CSS, and  JavaScript. Designed with user experience  in mind, Omni Food offers a seamless interface for exploring culinary  delights. From elegant layouts to  responsive design, every aspect of the  website reflects my commitment to  mastering front-end development.  Through this project, I've honed my skills in  HTML for structuring content, CSS for  styling and layout, and JavaScript for  interactivity. Omni Food isn't just a  website; it's a testament to my dedication  to learning and my passion for creating  impactful digital experiences.
